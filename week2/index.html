                <p>
                    Admittedly, I do not have a lot of experience with mapmaking (was one of the people who never rly heard of GIS before), but I hope that this class will teach me how to create maps that respect the different cultures and communities that they are meant to represent. Large datasets can be quite intimidating as just a complex set of numbers, so I would also love to be able to transform data into maps that are visually appealing but also much more digestible. I think gaining experience in mapping will open my eyes more to ethical issues that minorities face and the inaccuracies that exist in many current maps.
